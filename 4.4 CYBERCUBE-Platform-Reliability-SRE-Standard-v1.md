# CYBERCUBE Platform Reliability / SRE Standard (v1)

## Glossary

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the CYBERCUBE Platform Reliability / SRE Standard.

All definitions are normative unless stated otherwise.

### A

**Availability**

The proportion of time a service is operational and serving requests correctly.

Formula: `(Good Requests / Total Requests) × 100%`

Common targets:
- 99.9% (three nines) = ~8.76 hours downtime/year
- 99.95% = ~4.38 hours downtime/year
- 99.99% (four nines) = ~52.6 minutes downtime/year

### 1.2 Canonical Service Level Indicators (SLIs)

All CYBERCUBE services MUST implement these four canonical SLIs:

| SLI | Definition | Measurement | Target Range |
|-----|------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Availability** | Proportion of successful requests | `Good Requests / Total Requests` | 99.5% - 99.95% |
| **Latency** | Request response time | Percentile distribution (p50, p95, p99) | p95 < 200ms |
| **Error Rate** | Proportion of failed requests | `Failed Requests / Total Requests` | < 0.1% |
| **Saturation** | Resource utilization | CPU, memory, connections, queue depth | < 80% |

#### 1.2.1 Availability SLI Specification

**Definition:** The proportion of valid requests that are served successfully.

```
Availability = (Total Requests - Failed Requests) / Total Requests × 100%
```

**What counts as "available":**
- HTTP 2xx, 3xx responses
- Successful API operations
- Responses within timeout threshold

**What counts as "unavailable":**
- HTTP 5xx responses
- Timeouts exceeding SLO threshold
- Connection failures
- Service unreachable

**Measurement points:**
- Primary: Load balancer / API gateway
- Secondary: Application metrics
- Tertiary: Synthetic monitoring

#### 1.2.2 Latency SLI Specification

**Definition:** The time taken to serve a request, measured at specific percentiles.

| Percentile | Description | Use Case |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **p50** | Median (50% faster) | Typical experience |
| **p90** | 90% faster | Most users' experience |
| **p95** | 95% faster | SLO target |
| **p99** | 99% faster | Worst-case monitoring |

**Measurement scope:**
- From request received to response sent
- Excludes client network latency
- Per endpoint and aggregated

#### 1.2.3 Error Rate SLI Specification

**Definition:** The proportion of requests resulting in errors.

```
Error Rate = Failed Requests / Total Requests × 100%
```

| Category | Examples | Counts as Error? |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| Server errors | 5xx, timeouts, crashes | Yes |
| Client errors | 4xx (bad request, auth) | No |
| Rate limiting | 429 responses | No (expected) |
| Partial success | Degraded response | Configurable |

#### 1.2.4 Saturation SLI Specification

**Definition:** The degree to which a resource is being utilized.

| Resource | Warning | Critical | Emergency |
|----------|---------|----------|-----------|
| CPU | > 70% | > 85% | > 95% |
| Memory | > 75% | > 90% | > 95% |
| Connections | > 70% | > 85% | > 95% |
| Disk | > 80% | > 90% | > 95% |
| Queue Depth | > 100 | > 500 | > 1000 |

## 2. Resilience Engineering & Operations

### 2.1 Design Principles

All CYBERCUBE services MUST be designed with these resilience principles:

| Principle | Description | Implementation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Design for Failure** | Assume every component can fail | Redundancy, failover, graceful degradation |
| **Eliminate SPOF** | No single points of failure | Multi-instance, multi-zone deployment |
| **Prefer Automation** | Automate over human intervention | Self-healing, auto-scaling, automated rollback |
| **Fail Fast** | Detect and respond to failures quickly | Health checks, circuit breakers, timeouts |
| **Fail Safe** | Failures should not cascade | Bulkheads, isolation, load shedding |
| **Degrade Gracefully** | Partial function > no function | Feature flags, fallbacks, cached data |

### 2.2 Resilience Controls

#### 2.2.1 Redundancy

**Multi-Instance Deployment:**
- Minimum 2 instances per service (production)
- Prefer odd numbers for consensus (3, 5)
- Distribute across availability zones

**Multi-Zone Deployment:**
- Tier 1 services: 3+ availability zones
- Tier 2 services: 2+ availability zones
- Tier 3 services: 2+ availability zones

**Multi-Region Deployment (Tier 1 Critical — RECOMMENDED):**
- Primary region: Active
- Secondary region: Standby or Active-Active
- Failover: Automated or manual < 15 minutes
- NOTE: Multi-region is RECOMMENDED, not required. Evaluate based on service criticality and cost tolerance. Multi-zone is the minimum REQUIRED redundancy level.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### 2.2.2 Graceful Degradation

Services MUST implement graceful degradation strategies:

| Strategy | Trigger | Behavior |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Cached Fallback** | Database unavailable | Serve cached/stale data with warning |
| **Feature Disabling** | Non-critical dependency down | Disable affected features, core continues |
| **Read-Only Mode** | Write path failure | Allow reads, queue writes |
| **Static Response** | Complete failure | Serve static error page with status |
| **Reduced Functionality** | Partial failure | Offer limited feature set |

**Implementation example:**

```typescript
// Graceful degradation pattern
async function getProjectData(projectId: string): Promise<ProjectData> {
  try {
    // Primary: Live database query
    return await database.query(projectId);
  } catch (dbError) {
    logger.warn('Database unavailable, falling back to cache', { projectId, error: dbError });
    
    try {
      // Fallback 1: Cache
      const cached = await cache.get(`project:${projectId}`);
      if (cached) {
        return { ...cached, _stale: true, _cachedAt: cached.timestamp };
      }
    } catch (cacheError) {
      logger.warn('Cache unavailable', { projectId, error: cacheError });
    }
    
    // Fallback 2: Static/minimal response
    return {
      id: projectId,
      _unavailable: true,
      message: 'Data temporarily unavailable. Please try again shortly.',
    };
  }
}
```

#### 2.2.3 Circuit Breakers

Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures by stopping requests to failing dependencies.

**States:**

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Configuration:**

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `failureThreshold` | 5 | Failures before opening |
| `successThreshold` | 3 | Successes to close from half-open |
| `timeout` | 30s | Time before testing (half-open) |
| `monitoringWindow` | 10s | Window for failure counting |

#### 2.2.4 Retries with Backoff

Retry policies for transient failures:

| Component | Max Retries | Initial Backoff | Max Backoff | Jitter |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| Database | 3 | 100ms | 2s | ±20% |
| HTTP (internal) | 3 | 200ms | 5s | ±25% |
| HTTP (external) | 2 | 500ms | 10s | ±30% |
| Queue operations | 5 | 1s | 60s | ±20% |

**Retry requirements:**
- Operations MUST be idempotent
- Exponential backoff with jitter REQUIRED
- Circuit breaker SHOULD wrap retry logic
- Retries MUST respect timeout budgets

```typescript
// Retry with exponential backoff
async function withRetry<T>(
  operation: () => Promise<T>,
  options: RetryOptions
): Promise<T> {
  let lastError: Error;
  
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < options.maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await operation();
    } catch (error) {
      lastError = error;
      
      if (!isRetryable(error)) {
        throw error;
      }
      
      const baseDelay = options.initialBackoff * Math.pow(2, attempt);
      const jitter = baseDelay * options.jitterFactor * (Math.random() - 0.5);
      const delay = Math.min(baseDelay + jitter, options.maxBackoff);
      
      await sleep(delay);
    }
  }
  
  throw lastError;
}
```

#### 2.2.5 Timeouts

All external calls MUST have explicit timeouts:

| Operation Type | Recommended Timeout | Notes |
|----------------|---------------------|-------|
| Database query | 5s | Simple queries |
| Database query | 30s | Complex/batch |
| HTTP API call | 10s | Standard |
| HTTP API call | 30s | Long-running |
| Health check | 3s | Fast response required |
| Background job | 5 minutes | With progress tracking |

**Timeout budget pattern:**

```typescript
// Cascading timeout budgets
async function handleRequest(timeout: number): Promise<Response> {
  const deadline = Date.now() + timeout;
  
  // Allocate timeout budget across operations
  const authTimeout = Math.min(1000, timeout * 0.1);
  const dbTimeout = Math.min(5000, timeout * 0.5);
  const remainingTimeout = Math.max(0, deadline - Date.now());
  
  await authenticate({ timeout: authTimeout });
  const data = await queryDatabase({ timeout: dbTimeout });
  return formatResponse(data, { timeout: remainingTimeout });
}
```

#### 2.2.6 Load Shedding

When systems are overloaded, shed load to maintain availability:

| Strategy | Trigger | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Rate Limiting** | Request rate > limit | Return 429, retry-after header |
| **Priority Queuing** | Queue depth > threshold | Process high-priority first |
| **Request Dropping** | CPU > 95% | Drop lowest priority requests |
| **Connection Limiting** | Connections > limit | Reject new connections |
| **Adaptive Throttling** | Error rate increasing | Reduce request rate dynamically |

#### 2.2.7 Health Checks

All services MUST expose health check endpoints:

| Check Type | Purpose | Endpoint | Frequency |
|------------|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Liveness** | Process is running and not deadlocked | `/healthz` | Every 10s |
| **Readiness** | Service can accept traffic | `/readyz` | Every 5s |
| **Startup** | Service has completed initialization | `/startupz` | Every 5s (during boot) |

**Liveness check requirements:**
- Verify process is responsive (not hung)
- MUST NOT check external dependencies
- MUST respond within 3 seconds
- Failure triggers container/process restart

**Readiness check requirements:**
- Verify service can serve requests
- Check critical dependencies (database, cache)
- Failure removes instance from load balancer
- MUST NOT trigger restart

**Health check response format:**

```json
{
  "status": "ok | degraded | unhealthy",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "uptime_seconds": 86400,
  "checks": {
    "database": { "status": "ok", "latency_ms": 5 },
    "cache": { "status": "ok", "latency_ms": 1 }
  }
}
```

**Per-tier requirements:**

| Requirement | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Liveness probe | REQUIRED | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| Readiness probe | REQUIRED | REQUIRED | RECOMMENDED |
| Startup probe | REQUIRED | RECOMMENDED | OPTIONAL |
| Dependency checks in readiness | REQUIRED | REQUIRED | OPTIONAL |

### 2.3 Operational Practices

#### 2.3.1 Capacity Planning

Capacity planning MUST be performed quarterly:

**Inputs:**
- Historical usage patterns (90 days minimum)
- Growth projections (product roadmap)
- Seasonal variations (marketing calendar)
- Business events (launches, campaigns)

**Process:**

```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Output:**
- Resource allocation plan
- Scaling thresholds
- Cost projections
- Risk assessment

#### 2.3.2 Chaos Testing

Controlled fault injection validates resilience:

**Principles:**
1. Define steady state (what "normal" looks like)
2. Hypothesize that steady state continues during experiment
3. Introduce real-world failure scenarios
4. Observe differences between control and experiment
5. Learn and improve

**Experiment categories:**

| Category | Examples | Frequency |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Infrastructure** | Instance termination, zone outage | Quarterly |
| **Network** | Latency injection, packet loss | Quarterly |
| **Dependencies** | Database failure, cache unavailable | Quarterly |
| **Application** | Memory pressure, CPU exhaustion | Quarterly |
| **Data** | Corruption simulation, stale data | Semi-annually |

**Chaos testing requirements:**
- Start in non-production environments
- Production experiments require approval
- Always have rollback plan
- Monitor closely during experiments
- Document all learnings

#### 2.3.3 Safe Rollout Strategies

All production deployments MUST use safe rollout strategies:

**Canary Deployment (Default):**

**Blue-Green Deployment (Major changes):**

| Phase | Blue (Current) | Green (New) |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| 1. Deploy | Active (100%) | Deployed, idle |
| 2. Smoke test | Active (100%) | Internal testing |
| 3. Switch | Idle | Active (100%) |
| 4. Verify | Standby | Active, monitored |
| 5. Cleanup | Terminate after 24h | Production |

**Rollback criteria:**
- Automated: SLO breach detected
- Manual: Any anomaly observed
- Target: < 5 minutes to rollback

#### 2.3.4 Runbook Requirements

All Tier 1 and Tier 2 services MUST maintain operational runbooks. Runbooks bridge the gap between alerting and effective mitigation.

**Runbook structure:**

| Section | Content | Required? |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Service Overview** | What the service does, dependencies, owners | REQUIRED |
| **Architecture** | Key components, data flow, infrastructure | REQUIRED |
| **Alert Response** | Per-alert triage steps and remediation | REQUIRED |
| **Common Failures** | Known failure modes and fixes | REQUIRED |
| **Scaling** | How to scale up/down, capacity limits | REQUIRED |
| **Rollback** | Step-by-step rollback procedure | REQUIRED |
| **Contacts** | On-call, escalation, vendor contacts | REQUIRED |
| **Troubleshooting** | Diagnostic commands, log locations, dashboards | RECOMMENDED |

**Per-tier requirements:**

| Requirement | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Runbook exists | REQUIRED | REQUIRED | RECOMMENDED |
| Linked from alerts | REQUIRED | REQUIRED | RECOMMENDED |
| Reviewed quarterly | REQUIRED | RECOMMENDED | OPTIONAL |
| Tested via game day | RECOMMENDED | OPTIONAL | OPTIONAL |

**Runbook maintenance:**
- Runbooks MUST be updated after every incident that reveals gaps
- Runbooks MUST be stored in version control alongside service code or in a central wiki
- Each alert SHOULD link directly to its corresponding runbook section

---

## 3. Incident Interface, Toil & Governance

### 3.1 SRE Incident Interface

SRE owns detection and initial response; Incident Response Standard governs execution.

| Phase | SRE Responsibility | Interface |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Detection** | Monitoring, alerting, anomaly detection | → Alert fires |
| **Triage** | Initial assessment, severity determination | → Incident declared |
| **Mitigation** | First-response actions, service restoration | → Incident Response |
| **Analysis** | Post-incident technical analysis | ← Postmortem |
| **Improvement** | Reliability improvements from learnings | → Engineering backlog |

**Handoff to Incident Response:**
- SRE declares incident severity
- SRE provides initial diagnostic information
- Incident Commander takes coordination
- SRE participates as SME

### 3.2 On-Call Practices

On-call is a critical SRE function. The following standards ensure sustainable, effective on-call rotations.

#### 3.2.1 On-Call Structure

| Parameter | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Rotation length** | 1 week (recommended) |
| **Rotation size** | Minimum 4 engineers per rotation (to allow healthy intervals) |
| **Overlap** | 30-minute handoff overlap between rotations |
| **Coverage** | 24/7 for Tier 1 services; business-hours for Tier 2/3 |
| **Escalation** | Secondary on-call must be designated |

#### 3.2.2 On-Call Expectations

**During on-call shift:**
- Acknowledge alerts within 5 minutes (Tier 1) or 15 minutes (Tier 2)
- Have laptop and internet access available
- Follow runbooks for initial triage
- Escalate when issue exceeds individual expertise or SLO is at risk

**Handoff protocol:**
- Outgoing on-call documents all active issues and context
- Incoming on-call reviews open alerts, recent incidents, and error budget status
- Handoff logged in on-call tool or shared channel

#### 3.2.3 On-Call Health

| Metric | Target | Action if Exceeded |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Pages per shift | ≤ 2 per day | Alert tuning required |
| After-hours pages | ≤ 1 per night | Root cause analysis |
| False positive rate | ≤ 20% | Alert review and cleanup |
| Toil from on-call | ≤ 25% of capacity | Automate or reduce noise |

**Sustainability rules:**
- On-call engineers receive compensatory time or pay per company policy
- If page volume exceeds targets for 2+ rotations, alert tuning is REQUIRED
- On-call retrospective held monthly to review pain points and improve

### 3.3 Toil Management

**Definition:** Toil is work that is manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, lacking enduring value, and scales with service growth.

#### 3.3.1 Toil Identification

| Characteristic | Description | Example |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| **Manual** | Requires human action | Restarting services |
| **Repetitive** | Done frequently | Weekly report generation |
| **Automatable** | Machine could do it | Data cleanup scripts |
| **Tactical** | Reactive, not strategic | Responding to alerts |
| **No Enduring Value** | Doesn't improve the system | Manual failovers |
| **Scales with Growth** | More work as service grows | User provisioning |

#### 3.3.2 Toil Budget

| Metric | Target | Action if Exceeded |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Toil percentage | ≤ 50% of SRE capacity | Automation required |
| Toil per service | ≤ 4 hours/week | Process improvement |
| Interrupt-driven work | ≤ 25% of capacity | Alert tuning |

**Toil reduction process:**

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### 3.3.3 Automation Requirements

Automation is REQUIRED when:
- Same task performed > 3 times/week
- Task takes > 30 minutes/occurrence
- Task is error-prone when done manually
- Task is on critical path
- Toil budget exceeded

### 3.4 Governance & Review

|--------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Service Review** | Monthly | Service owner, SRE | SLOs, incidents, improvements |
| **SLO Review** | Quarterly | Engineering leads | Target adjustments, trends |
| **Architecture Review** | Per change | Principal engineers | Reliability implications |
| **Postmortem Review** | Per incident | IC, responders, stakeholders | Learnings, action items |

#### 3.4.2 SLO Review Process

Quarterly review of all service SLOs:

| Step | Action | Owner |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Collect SLO performance data | SRE |
| 2 | Analyze trends and patterns | Service Owner |
| 3 | Review business requirements | Product |

- New services MUST be registered before production deployment
- Decommissioned services MUST be marked inactive

#### 3.4.4 Postmortem Action Tracking

All postmortem action items MUST be tracked to closure:

| Priority | Timeline | Review Cadence |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| P1 (Critical) | 1 week | Daily |
| P2 (High) | 2 weeks | Weekly |
| P3 (Medium) | 1 month | Bi-weekly |
| P4 (Low) | Backlog | Monthly |

**Tracking requirements:**
- Clear owner assigned
- Specific due date
- Definition of done
- Linked to incident
- Progress tracked in weekly review

### 3.5 Prohibited Practices

The following practices are PROHIBITED:

| Practice | Reason | Alternative |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| ❌ Operating without defined SLOs | No reliability baseline | Define SLOs before production |
| ❌ Ignoring error budgets | Disables velocity/reliability balance | Enforce error budget policy |
| ❌ Manual fixes without automation | Toil accumulates | Automate after second occurrence |
| ❌ Reliability work deferred indefinitely | Debt accumulates | Allocate 20%+ capacity to reliability |
| ❌ Skipping postmortems | No learning from failures | Mandatory for SEV-1/SEV-2 |
| ❌ Single points of failure | Unacceptable risk | Redundancy required |
| ❌ Deployments without rollback plan | Recovery delayed | Rollback plan required |
| ❌ Ignoring capacity planning | Surprise failures | Quarterly capacity reviews |

## CYBERCUBE SRE — Quick Reference Card

Print it. Keep it handy.

### 🔹 Reliability Model

```
SLI → SLO → Error Budget → Velocity Decision
 │      │        │
 │      │        └─ Allowance: (1 - SLO) × Time
 │      └─ Target: "99.9% availability"
 └─ Signal: Availability, Latency, Errors, Saturation
```

### 🔹 SLO Targets

| Tier | Availability | Latency p95 | Error Rate |
|------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 1 (Critical) | 99.95% | < 200ms | < 0.05% |
| 2 (High) | 99.9% | < 500ms | < 0.1% |
| 3 (Standard) | 99.5% | < 2000ms | < 0.5% |

### 🔹 Error Budget Status

| Status | Budget | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|
| 🟢 Green | > 50% | Normal velocity |
| 🟡 Yellow | 25-50% | Increased caution |
| 🟠 Orange | 10-25% | Feature freeze |
| 🔴 Red | < 10% | Reliability-first |

### 🔹 Burn Rate Alerts

| Rate | Exhaustion | Response |
|------|------------|----------|
| 2x | 15 days | Monitor |
| 6x | 5 days | Warning |
| 14.4x | 2 days | Alert |
| 36x | 20 hours | Emergency |

### 🔹 Golden Signals

```
Latency    → How long requests take
Traffic    → How much demand
Errors     → How often requests fail
Saturation → How full resources are
```

### 🔹 Resilience Controls

| Control | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Redundancy | Survive instance/zone failure |
| Graceful degradation | Partial function > no function |
| Circuit breaker | Stop cascading failures |
| Retry + backoff | Handle transient failures |
| Timeout | Bound wait times |
| Load shedding | Survive overload |

### 🔹 Canary Stages

```
1% → 5% → 25% → 50% → 100%
│
└─ Auto-rollback if error rate > 2x
```

### 🔹 Toil Budget

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Total toil | ≤ 50% capacity |
| Per service | ≤ 4 hours/week |
| Interrupts | ≤ 25% capacity |

### 🔹 Key Response Times

| Metric | Tier 1 | Tier 2 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| MTTD | < 5 min | < 10 min |
| MTTR | < 1 hour | < 4 hours |

### 🔹 DO's

✅ Define SLOs before production
✅ Enforce error budget policy
✅ Design for failure
✅ Automate repetitive tasks
✅ Use safe rollout strategies
✅ Track postmortem actions to closure
✅ Run chaos experiments regularly

### 🔹 DON'Ts

❌ Operate without SLOs
❌ Ignore error budgets
❌ Manual fixes without automation
❌ Defer reliability work indefinitely
❌ Skip postmortems
❌ Deploy without rollback plan
❌ Single points of failure
