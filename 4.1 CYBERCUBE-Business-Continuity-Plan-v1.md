# CYBERCUBE Business Continuity Plan (v1)

**Status:** Active  
**Effective:** 2026-01-17  
**Classification:** CONFIDENTIAL  
**Owner:** Chief Operating Officer  
**Review Cycle:** Annual + after any activation

---

## 0. Purpose & Scope

This Business Continuity Plan (BCP) ensures CYBERCUBE can maintain or rapidly
resume critical business operations during and after disruptions that impact
people, processes, vendors, or facilities—beyond purely technical failures.

**Industry Alignment:**
- ISO 22301 (Business Continuity Management)
- ISO 22313 (BCP Guidance)
- SOC 2 Type II (Availability)
- NIST SP 800-34 (Contingency Planning)
- Enterprise Risk Management frameworks

**Scope:**
- Personnel disruptions (illness, departure, unavailability)
- Vendor and supply chain disruptions
- Facility disruptions
- Communication disruptions
- Remote operations continuity
- Crisis management
- Organizational succession

**Out of Scope:**
- Technical disaster recovery — see Backup & DR Standard
- Security incidents — see Incident Response Standard
- Long-term financial strategy and treasury management — see Finance procedures

> **Note:** Operational financial transactions (payroll, customer billing) remain
> in-scope as Tier 2 critical functions within this plan.

**Design Principles:**

1. **People First** — Safety and wellbeing are paramount
2. **Prepared** — Plans exist before crises occur
3. **Practiced** — Regular drills validate readiness
4. **Documented** — Clear procedures accessible when needed
5. **Resilient** — Multiple paths to operational continuity

> escalation routes to the backup automatically.
