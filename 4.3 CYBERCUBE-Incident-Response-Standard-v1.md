This document does NOT define:
- Security incident handling — see Security Incident Standard
- Alerting configuration — see Observability Standard
- On-call compensation — see HR policies

1. Severity Classification

Incidents are classified by severity to determine response urgency and resources.

1.1 Severity Levels

| Severity | Name | Impact | Response Time | Example |
|----------|------|--------|---------------|---------|
| SEV-1 | Critical | Complete outage, data loss, security breach | Immediate (< 5 min) | Platform down, data breach |
| SEV-2 | Major | Significant degradation, major feature down | < 15 minutes | Payment processing down |
| SEV-3 | Minor | Limited impact, workaround available | < 1 hour | Single customer affected |
| SEV-4 | Low | Minimal impact, no urgency | Next business day | Cosmetic issue, minor bug |

1.2 Severity Decision Matrix

| Factor | SEV-1 | SEV-2 | SEV-3 | SEV-4 |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Users affected | All / Most | Many | Few | Single |
| Revenue impact | Significant | Moderate | Minor | None |
| Data at risk (see 3.3) | Yes | Possible | No | No |
| Security breach | Yes | Suspected | No | No |
| Workaround | None | Difficult | Available | Easy |
| SLA violation | Imminent | Possible | Unlikely | No |

1.3 Severity Examples

- Mitigation failing
- Duration extending
- New symptoms discovered

**Downgrade triggers:**
- Mitigation successful
- Impact contained
- Workaround found
- Customer communication clear

Document severity changes in timeline.

2. Incident Lifecycle

Every incident follows a defined lifecycle from detection to closure.

2.1 Lifecycle Phases

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

2.2 When to Declare an Incident

Not every issue is an incident. Declare an incident when ANY of the following are true:

**Declare immediately:**
- Customer-facing service is degraded or unavailable
- SLO is breached or at imminent risk of breach
- Data loss, corruption, or unauthorized access is suspected
- Multiple customers report the same issue
- Automated monitoring triggers a SEV-1 or SEV-2 alert

**Declare after assessment (within 15 minutes):**
- A single customer reports impact with no obvious workaround
- Internal tooling outage blocks customer-impacting work
- A deployment causes unexpected error rate increase
- Third-party dependency failure affects production

**NOT an incident (use normal ticket workflow):**
- Bug affecting a single user with easy workaround
- Cosmetic/UI issues with no functional impact
- Internal tooling inconvenience with workaround
- Feature request or improvement suggestion

When in doubt, declare an incident. It is always better to declare and downgrade than to miss a real incident.

2.3 Phase 1: Detection

**Goal:** Identify incidents as quickly as possible.

Sources:
- Automated monitoring alerts
- Customer reports
- Internal reports
- Partner notifications
- Third-party monitoring

Detection SLOs:
| Severity | Target MTTD |
|----------|-------------|
| SEV-1 | < 5 minutes |
| SEV-2 | < 10 minutes |
| SEV-3 | < 30 minutes |
| SEV-4 | < 4 hours |

2.4 Phase 2: Triage

**Goal:** Assess severity and mobilize response.

Steps:
1. Acknowledge alert (MTTA < 5 min for SEV-1/2)
2. Assess impact and symptoms
3. Assign initial severity
4. Create incident channel
5. Page appropriate responders
6. Begin timeline

Triage questions:
- What service is affected?
- How many users impacted?
- Is there data loss risk?
- Is there a security concern?
- What is customer-visible impact?
- Is there a workaround?

2.5 Phase 3: Response

**Goal:** Mitigate impact and diagnose root cause.

Parallel tracks:
```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│   MITIGATION    │     │   DIAGNOSIS     │
├─────────────────┤     ├─────────────────┤
│ • Rollback      │     │ • Review logs   │
│ • Failover      │     │ • Check metrics │
│ • Scale         │     │ • Trace requests│
│ • Block traffic │     │ • Review changes│
│ • Enable cache  │     │ • Test theories │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

Mitigation first, then diagnose:
- Restore service before root cause
- Don't let perfect be enemy of good
- Workarounds are acceptable

2.6 Phase 4: Resolution

**Goal:** Confirm service is restored and stable.

Resolution criteria:
- Service metrics normal
- No elevated errors
- Customer-confirmed working
- Stable for 15+ minutes
- Monitoring in place

Post-resolution:
1. Update status page (Resolved)
2. Send customer notification
3. Notify stakeholders
4. Schedule postmortem
5. Close incident channel (after postmortem)

2.7 Phase 5: Postmortem

**Goal:** Learn from the incident and prevent recurrence.

Required for: SEV-1, SEV-2
Optional for: SEV-3, SEV-4

Timeline:
- Draft: Within 48 hours
- Review: Within 1 week
- Action items assigned: Within 1 week
- Publish: Within 2 weeks

5. Escalation

Escalation brings additional resources or authority to incident response.

5.1 Escalation Types

| Type | When | Who |
|------|------|-----|
| Functional | Need expertise | SME, other team |
| Hierarchical | Need authority | Manager, Director, VP |
| External | Vendor issue | Vendor support, partners |

5.2 Escalation Triggers

**Escalate when:**
- Incident not improving after 30 minutes
- Beyond responder's expertise
- Need authorization for changes
- Customer or business escalation
- Potential PR/legal issue
- Security incident suspected
- Data loss possible

**Don't hesitate to escalate:**
- Better to over-escalate than under
- No penalty for escalating
- IC makes the call

5.3 Escalation Paths

**Technical escalation:**
```
On-Call → Team Lead → Service Owner → Principal Engineer → CTO
```

**Business escalation:**
```
Support → Support Manager → Account Manager → VP Customer Success → CEO
```

**Security escalation:**
```
On-Call → Security Team → Security Lead → CISO → CEO/Legal
```

5.4 Escalation Contacts

| Role | Contact Method | Response Time |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| On-Call | PagerDuty | 5 minutes |
| Team Lead | PagerDuty + Slack | 10 minutes |
| Engineering Manager | Phone | 15 minutes |
| VP Engineering | Phone | 15 minutes |
| CTO | Phone | 15 minutes |
| CEO | Phone | 30 minutes |

Emergency contacts maintained in:
- PagerDuty escalation policies
- Incident runbook (offline copy)
- Physical emergency binder

5.5 Vendor Escalation

For third-party dependencies:

| Vendor | Support Level | Contact |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| AWS | Enterprise Support | TAM + Support case |
| Stripe | Priority Support | Dashboard + phone |
| Datadog | Premium Support | Chat + phone |
| [Others] | Per contract | [Details] |

Vendor escalation checklist:
- [ ] Open support case immediately
- [ ] Request severity upgrade if needed
- [ ] Ask for dedicated engineer
- [ ] Escalate through TAM if available
- [ ] Document case numbers

5.6 BCP/DR Escalation Criteria

An incident triggers Business Continuity (4.1) or Disaster Recovery (4.2) activation when:

| Trigger | Threshold | Activates |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Service RTO breach | Incident duration exceeds service RTO | DR failover procedures (4.2) |
| Multi-region failure | Primary AND secondary regions impacted | DR — regional failover (4.2) |
| Confirmed data loss | Unrecoverable data corruption or loss | DR — backup restore (4.2) |
| Facility unavailable | Office/datacenter inaccessible | BCP — alternate site (4.1) |
| Key personnel unavailable | >50% of critical team unreachable | BCP — succession plan (4.1) |
| Extended outage | SEV-1 unresolved >4 hours | BCP crisis management team activated (4.1) |

Process:
1. IC identifies BCP/DR trigger condition
2. IC escalates to VP Engineering + BCP Coordinator
3. BCP Coordinator makes activation decision
4. Incident response continues in parallel with BCP/DR procedures
5. Unified communication — IC coordinates with BCP Coordinator on stakeholder updates

Cross-references:
- Business Continuity Plan (4.1) — activation criteria, crisis team
- Backup & Disaster Recovery Standard (4.2) — failover, restore procedures

6. Communication

Clear communication is critical during incidents.

6.1 Regulatory & Privacy Notification

If an incident involves exposure, loss, or unauthorized access to personal data:

1. **Immediately** notify the Privacy/Compliance lead
2. Invoke Privacy Handling Policy (3.2) assessment procedures
3. Assess notification obligations per DPA Standard (3.6)
4. Document data categories affected per Data Classification Standard (3.3)

Regulatory timelines that may apply:
- **GDPR:** 72-hour notification to supervisory authority
- **US State Breach Laws:** Varies (24h–60 days depending on state)
- **Contractual (DPA):** Per customer DPA terms

The Communication Lead coordinates with Legal/Compliance on any external regulatory notification. This runs in parallel with — not instead of — standard incident response.

6.2 Communication Channels

| Channel | Purpose | Audience |
|---------|---------|----------|
| #incident-{id} | Response coordination | Responders |
| #incidents | Awareness | Engineering |
| Status page | Customer notification | Customers |
| Email | Formal notification | Stakeholders |
| Bridge call | Voice coordination | Responders (SEV-1) |

6.3 Incident Channel Setup

Create immediately on SEV-1/2:

Channel name: `#incident-{date}-{short-description}`

Example: `#incident-20260117-api-outage`

| SEV-1 | Yes | Draft within 48 hours |
| SEV-2 | Yes | Draft within 1 week |
| SEV-3 | Optional | If significant learning |
| SEV-4 | No | Unless requested |

7.2 Postmortem Template

```markdown
# Postmortem: {Incident Title}

**Incident ID:** INC-20260117-001
**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Duration:** 2 hours 15 minutes
**Severity:** SEV-1
**Authors:** Alice, Bob
**Status:** Final

## Executive Summary
{2-3 sentence summary of what happened and impact}

## Impact
- **Duration:** 13:15 UTC - 15:30 UTC (2h 15m)
- **Users Affected:** ~2,500 (all production users)
- **Revenue Impact:** ~$X in processing delayed
- **SLA Impact:** Below 99.9% target for January
- **Customer Tickets:** 47 tickets opened

## Timeline (UTC)
| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 13:15 | Database primary begins showing connection errors |
| 13:18 | Automated alert fires: db-connection-exhaustion |
| 13:20 | On-call acknowledges, begins investigation |
| 13:25 | SEV-1 declared, incident channel created |
| 13:30 | IC assigned (Alice), team mobilized |
| 13:45 | Root cause identified: connection leak in billing-service v2.3 |
| 14:00 | Mitigation: connection pool size increased |
| 14:15 | Partial recovery observed |
| 14:30 | Decision to rollback billing-service to v2.2 |
| 14:45 | Rollback complete |
| 15:00 | Full service recovery confirmed |
| 15:30 | Incident resolved, monitoring continues |

## Root Cause
The billing-service v2.3 release (deployed 12:00 UTC) introduced a 
connection leak in the payment processing flow. Under load, connections 
were not properly returned to the pool, exhausting the database 
connection limit (500 connections) within 75 minutes.

## Contributing Factors
1. Connection leak not caught in code review
2. Load testing did not simulate production transaction volume
3. Connection pool monitoring alert threshold too high
4. No circuit breaker on database connections

## Resolution
- Immediate: Rolled back billing-service to v2.2
- Connection pool manually reset

## What Went Well
- Alert fired within 3 minutes of impact
- Team mobilized quickly
- Clear communication to customers
- Rollback process worked smoothly

## What Went Wrong
- Connection leak not caught before production
- Initial mitigation (pool size increase) insufficient
- Took 30 minutes to decide on rollback
- Load testing inadequate

## Lessons Learned
1. Need connection lifecycle testing in CI/CD
2. Need lower threshold on connection alerts
3. Need automated rollback capability
4. Need circuit breaker pattern for DB connections

## Action Items
| ID | Action | Owner | Due Date | Priority |
|----|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Add connection leak test to CI | Bob | 2026-01-24 | P1 |
| 2 | Lower connection alert threshold to 80% | Carol | 2026-01-20 | P1 |
| 3 | Implement circuit breaker for DB | Bob | 2026-02-01 | P2 |
| 4 | Review load test scenarios | Alice | 2026-01-31 | P2 |
| 5 | Add automated rollback for critical services | DevOps | 2026-02-15 | P2 |

7.4 Blameless Postmortem Culture

**DO:**
- Focus on systems and processes
- Ask "what" not "who"
- Assume everyone acted with good intent
- Look for systemic improvements
- Celebrate learning
- Share widely

**DON'T:**
- Blame individuals
- Punish for mistakes
- Hide incidents
- Skip postmortems
- Ignore action items
- Repeat the same failures

Questions that help:
- "What information was missing?"
- "What could we automate?"
- "What monitoring would help?"
- "What would have prevented this?"

7.5 Action Item Tracking

Action item requirements:
- Clear owner
- Specific due date
- Priority (P1-P4)
- Link to incident
- Definition of done

Priority guidelines:
| Priority | Timeline | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| P1 | 1 week | Critical prevention |
| P2 | 1 month | Important improvement |
| P3 | 1 quarter | Nice to have |
| P4 | Backlog | Future consideration |

Tracking:
- Track in incident management system
- Review weekly in team meeting
- Monthly incident review includes action item status
- Close only when verified complete

Accountability:
- **DRI (Directly Responsible Individual):** Engineering Manager or SRE Lead owns overall action-item tracking
- Items overdue by >1 week: DRI escalates to item owner's manager
- Items overdue by >2 weeks: flagged in monthly reliability review (§8.3)
- Completion rate tracked as a team metric (target: >90% on-time for P1/P2)

8. Metrics & Reporting

Track incident metrics to measure and improve reliability.

8.1 Key Metrics
