CYBERCUBE Privacy Handling Policy (v1)

Status: Active
Effective: 2026-01-17
Classification: INTERNAL — Not for External Distribution
Applies to: All CYBERCUBE employees, contractors, and systems

0. Purpose & Design Principles

This policy establishes how CYBERCUBE handles personal data across all
operations. It ensures compliance with privacy regulations, protects
individual rights, and maintains trust with customers and users.

Regulatory alignment:

- GDPR (EU General Data Protection Regulation)
- CCPA/CPRA (California Consumer Privacy Act/Rights Act)
- UK GDPR (post-Brexit)
- LGPD (Brazil)
- Other applicable privacy laws

Design principles:

1. **Privacy by Design** — Build privacy into all systems
2. **Data Minimization** — Collect only what's necessary
3. **Purpose Limitation** — Use data only as stated
4. **Transparency** — Be clear about data practices
5. **Accountability** — Document and demonstrate compliance
6. **Individual Rights** — Respect and facilitate rights

Conventions:

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

This policy does NOT replace:

- Public Privacy Policy — see customer-facing document
- Data Classification & Retention Standard — data governance
- Security Policy — security controls

3.3 Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA)

Required before relying on legitimate interest:

```markdown
## Legitimate Interest Assessment

### Processing Activity
[Description of processing]

### Purpose Test
What is the legitimate interest?
- [ ] Business interest identified
- [ ] Interest is lawful
- [ ] Interest is clearly articulated

### Necessity Test
Is processing necessary for the purpose?
- [ ] Processing achieves the purpose
- [ ] No less intrusive way exists
- [ ] Processing is proportionate

### Balancing Test
Do individual rights override the interest?
- [ ] Nature of data considered
- [ ] Expectations of individuals assessed
- [ ] Impact on individuals evaluated
- [ ] Safeguards implemented

### Outcome
- [ ] APPROVED — Legitimate interest valid
- [ ] REJECTED — Use different basis or don't process
```
