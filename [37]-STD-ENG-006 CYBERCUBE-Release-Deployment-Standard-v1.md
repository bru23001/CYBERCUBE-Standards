CYBERCUBE Release & Deployment Standard (v1.1)

### Applicability Tier Table

| Applicability | Tier | Summary of Clauses in This Standard | Waiver Path |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------- | ----------- |
| All projects | **T1 MUST** | (1) All code MUST be in version control (Git) with a protected default branch that blocks force-push and requires at least one reviewer. (2) Production deploys MUST be produced from versioned, immutable artifacts (not rebuilt from the branch at deploy time). (3) Every deploy MUST have an identifiable version and an attributable author. (4) A documented rollback plan MUST exist for every production deploy (per POL-ENG-001 T1); rollback steps MUST be executable without re-building. (5) Database migrations MUST be reversible or accompanied by a documented forward-fix plan. | None (non-waivable) |
| SaaS / customer-facing | **T2 SHOULD** | CI pipeline with automated tests + basic security scan gating merge, staging environment with production parity ≥80%, standard health endpoints (`/healthz`, `/readyz`), release branch workflow, change notification to affected teams, artifact registry, feature flag system for risky rollouts. | Lightweight waiver per POL-GOV-001 §8.3 |
| Regulated / high-risk | **T3 MAY** | Artifact signing (cosign/sigstore) with policy-enforced verification at deploy, SBOM generation per release, segregation-of-duties between build and deploy, canary / blue-green deploy mechanics, automated rollback on health-check regression, deploy-time audit trail exported to SIEM, approval gates tied to STD-GOV-006 UCM controls. | Formal waiver per STD-GOV-003 |

> Per POL-GOV-001 §8.8.

> **v1.1 (2026-04-22) — Unfreeze (Path B).** T1 reduced to five rules enforceable today: Git + branch protection, immutable artifacts, versioned/attributable deploys, rollback plan, reversible migrations. Artifact signing, canary, feature flags, SBOM reclassified to T2/T3 ROADMAP. Tight coupling with POL-ENG-001 v1.1 (change request per T1 row) preserved.

Glossary

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the CYBERCUBE Release & Deployment
Standard.

All definitions are normative unless stated otherwise.

A

Artifact

CYBERCUBE branches (trunk-based):
- `main` — production code
- `feature/*` — new features
- `hotfix/*` — production fixes
- `release/*` — release preparation

Build

The process of creating deployable artifacts from source code.

Requirements:
- Reproducible
- Versioned
- Immutable output

C

Canary Deployment

A deployment strategy gradually rolling out to users.

Process:
1. Deploy to small subset (1-5%)

CYBERCUBE Release & Deployment Standard (v1)

Standard ID: STD-ENG-006
Status: Active
Effective: 2026-01-17
Applies to: All CYBERCUBE production deployments

0. Purpose & Design Principles

This standard defines how CYBERCUBE manages releases, deployments, and production
changes. It ensures safe, controlled, and traceable modifications to production
systems while enabling rapid iteration.

Industry alignment:
- ITIL Change Management
- GitOps Principles
- The Twelve-Factor App
- Google SRE Release Engineering

Design principles:

1. **Safety First** — Protect production at all costs
2. **Automation** — Automate everything possible
3. **Immutability** — Build once, deploy anywhere
4. **Traceability** — Every change is tracked
5. **Reversibility** — Every deployment can be rolled back
6. **Progressive** — Roll out gradually, not all at once

This document does NOT define:
- Incident response — see Incident Response Standard
- Security scanning — see Security Standard
- Secrets management — see Security Standard
- Test requirements — see Testing Standard

Target deployment cadence: Weekly releases minimum; daily for patches.

1. Environments

CYBERCUBE maintains distinct environments for development, testing, and production.

| Security controls | Same rules |

Allowed differences:
- Scale (fewer replicas)
- Data (anonymized)
- External integrations (sandbox mode)

2. Version Control & Branching

Git is the source of truth for all code and configuration.

2.1 Branching Strategy

CYBERCUBE uses trunk-based development with short-lived branches:

```
main (production)
  │
  ├── feature/user-auth ──────────┐
  │                               │ (merge via PR)
  ├── feature/billing-v2 ─────┐  │
  │                           │  │
  ├───────────────────────────┴──┴── main
  │
  ├── hotfix/fix-login ───────────┐
  │                               │ (emergency merge)
  └───────────────────────────────┴── main
```

2.2 Branch Types

| Type | Pattern | Purpose | Lifetime |
|------|---------|---------|----------|
| Main | `main` | Production code | Permanent |
| Feature | `feature/{ticket}-{desc}` | New features | < 1 week |
| Hotfix | `hotfix/{ticket}-{desc}` | Emergency fixes | < 1 day |
| Release | `release/v{version}` | Release stabilization | < 1 week |

Examples:
```
feature/CC-1234-user-authentication
feature/CC-5678-billing-dashboard
hotfix/CC-9999-fix-login-error
release/v2.3.0
```

2.3 Commit Standards

Commit message format:
```
{type}({scope}): {description}

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation |
| `style` | Formatting |
| `refactor` | Code restructure |
| `perf` | Performance |
| `test` | Tests |
| `chore` | Maintenance |

Examples:
```

```yaml
# GitHub branch protection
branches:
  - name: main
    protection:
      required_pull_request_reviews:
        required_approving_review_count: 1
        dismiss_stale_reviews: true
        require_code_owner_reviews: true
      required_status_checks:
        strict: true
        contexts:
          - "ci/test"
          - "ci/lint"
          - "ci/security"
      enforce_admins: true
      restrictions: null
```

3. Build & Artifact Management

Builds produce immutable, versioned artifacts.

3.1 Build Principles

1. **Reproducible** — Same commit produces same artifact
2. **Immutable** — Artifacts never modified after creation
3. **Versioned** — Every artifact has unique version
4. **Signed** (RECOMMENDED) — Artifacts are cryptographically signed (Phase 2)
5. **Scanned** — Security scanning before storage

3.2 Version Numbering

Semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

```
v2.3.1
│ │ │
│ │ └── PATCH: Bug fixes (backward compatible)
│ └──── MINOR: New features (backward compatible)
└────── MAJOR: Breaking changes
```

Pre-release versions:
```
v2.3.0-alpha.1    # Alpha release
v2.3.0-beta.2     # Beta release
v2.3.0-rc.1       # Release candidate
```

Build metadata:
```
v2.3.1+build.12345.sha.a1b2c3d
```

3.3 Artifact Naming

Format: `{service}-{version}`

Examples:
```
api-service:v2.3.1
web-app:v2.3.1
billing-worker:v2.3.1
```

Container images:
```
registry.cybercube.software/api-service:v2.3.1
registry.cybercube.software/api-service:v2.3.1-sha-a1b2c3d
registry.cybercube.software/api-service:latest  # Only for dev
```

3.4 Build Pipeline

```yaml
# .github/workflows/build.yml

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

4.2 Stage Requirements

| Stage | Requirements | Failure Action |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| Build | Compiles successfully | Block pipeline |
| Test | All tests pass, coverage met | Block pipeline |
| Scan | No critical/high vulnerabilities | Block pipeline |
| Staging | Deploys successfully, E2E pass | Block pipeline |
| Production | Approved, healthy deployment | Rollback |

4.3 Deployment Methods

| Method | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Rolling | Update instances incrementally | Default |
| Blue-Green | Switch traffic between environments | Zero-downtime |
| Canary | Gradual traffic shift | High-risk changes |
| Recreate | Stop old, start new | Development |

4.4 Rolling Deployment

```yaml
# Kubernetes rolling deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1        # Max extra pods during update
      maxUnavailable: 0  # Always maintain capacity
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: api
          image: registry.cybercube.software/api:v2.3.1
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health/ready
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 5
            periodSeconds: 5
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health/live
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 15
            periodSeconds: 10
```

4.5 Canary Deployment (Advanced — not required for baseline)

When risk warrants it, use canary deployments with automated analysis.
This requires Argo Rollouts or equivalent; adopt in Phase 3+.

4.6 Health Checks

Every service implements health endpoints:

```typescript
// Health check endpoints
export const healthRoutes = {
  // Liveness: Is the process running?
  '/health/live': async () => ({
    status: 'ok',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  }),
  
  // Readiness: Can it serve traffic?
  '/health/ready': async () => {
    const checks = await Promise.all([
      checkDatabase(),
      checkCache(),
      checkDependencies(),
    ]);
    
    const healthy = checks.every(c => c.status === 'ok');
    
    return {
      status: healthy ? 'ok' : 'degraded',
      checks: checks,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    };
  },
  
  // Detailed health for debugging
  // IMPORTANT: Restrict /health to internal network only.
  // Do NOT expose to public internet — it leaks runtime internals.
  '/health': async () => ({
    status: 'ok',
    version: process.env.VERSION,
    git_sha: process.env.GIT_SHA,
    uptime: process.uptime(),
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  }),
};
```

4.7 Post-Deployment Verification

Automated checks after deployment:

```typescript
// Post-deployment verification
async function verifyDeployment(service: string, version: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const checks = [
    // Health check
    async () => {
      const health = await fetch(`${service}/health`);
      return health.ok && (await health.json()).version === version;
    },
    
    // Key endpoint check
    async () => {
      const response = await fetch(`${service}/api/v1/health`);
      return response.ok;
    },
    
    // Error rate check
    async () => {
      const errorRate = await getMetric(`${service}_error_rate_5m`);
      return errorRate < 0.01; // < 1% errors
    },
    
    // Latency check
    async () => {
      const p99 = await getMetric(`${service}_latency_p99_5m`);
      return p99 < 500; // < 500ms p99
    },
  ];
  
  const results = await Promise.all(checks.map(c => c().catch(() => false)));
  return results.every(Boolean);
}
```

7. Feature Flags

Feature flags control feature rollout without deployment.

7.1 Feature Flag Types

| Type | Purpose | Lifetime | Example |
|------|---------|----------|---------|
| Release | Control feature rollout | Temporary | `new_dashboard` |
| Ops | Enable kill switches | Permanent | `enable_caching` |
| Experiment | A/B testing | Temporary | `checkout_v2` |
| Permission | Entitlements | Permanent | `premium_features` |

7.2 Flag Naming Convention

Format: `{type}_{feature}_{variant}`

```
release_new_dashboard
release_billing_v2
ops_cache_enabled
ops_rate_limit_strict
experiment_checkout_flow_v2
permission_advanced_analytics
```

7.3 Flag Structure

```typescript
interface FeatureFlag {
  key: string;                    // Unique identifier
  name: string;                   // Human-readable name
  description: string;            // What this flag controls
  type: 'release' | 'ops' | 'experiment' | 'permission';
  
  // Default state
  defaultValue: boolean | string | number;
  
  // Targeting rules
  rules: TargetingRule[];
  
  // Rollout percentage (0-100)
  rolloutPercentage: number;
  
  // Metadata
  owner: string;                  // Team/person responsible
  createdAt: Date;
  expiresAt?: Date;               // For temporary flags
  tags: string[];
}

interface TargetingRule {
  attribute: string;              // user.id, tenant.id, etc.
  operator: 'eq' | 'in' | 'contains' | 'percentage';
  value: any;
  result: boolean | string | number;
}
```

7.4 Flag Implementation

```typescript
// Feature flag service
export class FeatureFlagService {
  private flags: Map<string, FeatureFlag>;
  private provider: FlagProvider;
  
  async isEnabled(
    key: string,
    context: EvaluationContext
  ): Promise<boolean> {
    const flag = await this.getFlag(key);
    
    if (!flag) {
      console.warn(`Unknown feature flag: ${key}`);
      return false;
    }
    
    // Evaluate targeting rules
    for (const rule of flag.rules) {
      if (this.matchesRule(rule, context)) {
        return rule.result as boolean;
      }
    }
    
    // Evaluate percentage rollout
    if (flag.rolloutPercentage < 100) {
      const hash = this.hashContext(key, context);
      return (hash % 100) < flag.rolloutPercentage;
    }
    
    return flag.defaultValue as boolean;
  }
  
  async getValue<T>(
    key: string,
    context: EvaluationContext,
    defaultValue: T
  ): Promise<T> {
    const flag = await this.getFlag(key);
    
    if (!flag) {
      return defaultValue;
    }
    
    // Similar evaluation logic...
    return flag.defaultValue as T ?? defaultValue;
  }
}

// Usage in application code
async function renderDashboard(user: User) {
  const flags = getFeatureFlags();
  
  if (await flags.isEnabled('release_new_dashboard', { user })) {
    return renderNewDashboard(user);
  }
  
  return renderLegacyDashboard(user);
}
```

```

7.6 Flag Cleanup

Release flags must be removed after full rollout:

```typescript
// Flag with expiration
const flag: FeatureFlag = {
  key: 'release_new_checkout',
  type: 'release',
  expiresAt: new Date('2026-02-17'),  // 30 days from creation
  // ...
};

// Automated cleanup check
async function checkExpiredFlags(): Promise<void> {
  const flags = await getAllFlags();
  const now = new Date();
  
  for (const flag of flags) {
    if (flag.type === 'release' && flag.expiresAt && flag.expiresAt < now) {
      await notifyFlagOwner(flag, 'Flag has expired, please clean up');
    }
  }
}
```

Flag cleanup checklist:
- [ ] Flag enabled at 100% for 2+ weeks
- [ ] No issues reported
- [ ] Remove flag checks from code
- [ ] Remove flag from configuration
- [ ] Update documentation

8. Rollback Procedures

Every deployment must be reversible.

8.1 Rollback Triggers

Initiate rollback when:
- Error rate exceeds threshold (> 5%)
- Latency exceeds threshold (> 2x baseline)
- Health checks failing
- Critical functionality broken
- Customer-reported issues

8.2 Rollback Methods

| Method | Speed | Use Case |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Feature flag | Instant | Flag-controlled features |
| Traffic shift | Seconds | Blue-green deployments |
| Redeploy | Minutes | Container rollback |
| Database restore | Hours | Data corruption |

8.3 Application Rollback

```yaml
# Kubernetes rollback
kubectl rollout undo deployment/api-service

# Rollback to specific revision
kubectl rollout undo deployment/api-service --to-revision=3

# Check rollout history
kubectl rollout history deployment/api-service
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# rollback.sh - Automated rollback script

SERVICE=$1
TARGET_VERSION=$2

echo "Rolling back ${SERVICE} to ${TARGET_VERSION}"

# Update deployment
kubectl set image deployment/${SERVICE} \
  ${SERVICE}=registry.cybercube.software/${SERVICE}:${TARGET_VERSION}

# Wait for rollout
kubectl rollout status deployment/${SERVICE} --timeout=5m

# Verify health
if ! curl -sf "http://${SERVICE}/health" > /dev/null; then
  echo "CRITICAL: Rollback failed health check"
  exit 1
fi

echo "Rollback complete"
```

8.4 Database Rollback

For migrations with data changes:

```sql
-- Migration: 20260117_add_tax_rate.sql
-- Up
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN tax_rate DECIMAL(5,4);
UPDATE products SET tax_rate = 0.1000 WHERE tax_rate IS NULL;

-- Down (rollback)
ALTER TABLE products DROP COLUMN tax_rate;
```

```typescript
// Safe migration pattern
export async function up(db: Database): Promise<void> {
  // 1. Add column (nullable)
  await db.query(`ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN tax_rate DECIMAL(5,4)`);
  
  // 2. Backfill data
  await db.query(`UPDATE products SET tax_rate = 0.1000 WHERE tax_rate IS NULL`);
  
  // 3. Add constraint (separate deployment)
  // await db.query(`ALTER TABLE products ALTER COLUMN tax_rate SET NOT NULL`);
}

export async function down(db: Database): Promise<void> {
  await db.query(`ALTER TABLE products DROP COLUMN tax_rate`);
}
```

8.5 Rollback Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Action | Owner |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Error rate > 5% | Auto-rollback | System |
| Error rate > 1% | Alert, manual decision | On-call |
| P99 latency > 2x | Alert, investigate | On-call |
| Customer reports | Investigate, manual rollback | On-call |
| Data corruption | Stop traffic, restore backup | Incident Commander |

8.6 Rollback Communication

```markdown
# Rollback Notification

Database changes require special handling.

9.1 Migration Principles

1. **Backward Compatible** — Old code works with new schema
2. **Reversible** — Can rollback without data loss
3. **Incremental** — Small changes, not big-bang
4. **Tested** — Run against production-like data
5. **Monitored** — Track migration progress

9.2 Migration Naming

Format: `{timestamp}_{description}.sql`

```
20260117120000_add_tax_rate_to_products.sql
20260117130000_create_audit_log_table.sql
20260117140000_add_index_users_email.sql
```

9.3 Safe Migration Patterns

**Adding a column:**
```sql
-- Phase 1: Add nullable column (deploy)
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR(20);

-- Phase 2: Backfill (background job)
UPDATE users SET phone = '' WHERE phone IS NULL;

-- Phase 3: Add constraint (deploy after backfill complete)
ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN phone SET NOT NULL;
```

**Renaming a column:**
```sql
-- Phase 1: Add new column
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN full_name VARCHAR(100);

-- Phase 2: Copy data (background)
UPDATE users SET full_name = name WHERE full_name IS NULL;

-- Phase 3: Update application to use new column

-- Phase 4: Drop old column (after application deployed)
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN name;
```

**Adding an index:**
```sql
-- Use CONCURRENTLY to avoid locking
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_email ON users(email);
```

9.4 Migration Checklist

```markdown
# Migration Checklist

## Before Migration
- [ ] Migration tested on staging with production-like data
- [ ] Rollback script prepared and tested
- [ ] Estimated duration calculated
- [ ] Lock impact assessed
- [ ] Backup verified
- [ ] Deployment window scheduled
- [ ] On-call notified

## During Migration
- [ ] Monitor database metrics
- [ ] Monitor application errors
- [ ] Ready to abort if issues

## After Migration
- [ ] Verify schema changes applied
- [ ] Verify application functioning
- [ ] Monitor for 30 minutes
- [ ] Document any issues
```

9.5 Migration Execution

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# migrate.sh - Database migration script

set -e

MIGRATION_DIR=$1
TARGET=$2

echo "Starting migration to ${TARGET}"
echo "Time: $(date -u)"

# Backup first
echo "Creating backup..."
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Run migrations
echo "Running migrations..."
for file in ${MIGRATION_DIR}/*.sql; do
  version=$(basename $file .sql | cut -d'_' -f1)
  
  if [ "$version" -le "$TARGET" ]; then
    echo "Applying: $file"
    psql $DATABASE_URL < $file
  fi
done

echo "Migration complete"
```

CYBERCUBE Release & Deployment — Quick Reference Card

Print it. Keep it handy.

🔹 Environments

| Env | Code | Purpose |
|-----|------|---------|
| Development | `dev` | Feature dev |
| Staging | `stg` | Pre-prod test |
| Production | `prd` | Live traffic |

🔹 Version Format

```
v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}
v2.3.1
```

🔹 Branch Strategy

```
main ← feature/{ticket}-{desc}
main ← hotfix/{ticket}-{desc}
```

🔹 Commit Format

```
{type}({scope}): {description}

feat(auth): add Google OAuth
fix(billing): correct tax calc
```

🔹 Deployment Pipeline

```
BUILD → TEST → SCAN → STG → PRD
```

🔹 Deployment Methods

| Method | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| Rolling | Default |
| Blue-Green | Zero downtime |
| Canary | High risk |

🔹 Release Approvals

| Risk | Approvers |
|------|-----------|
| Low | 1 engineer |
| Medium | Tech lead |
| High | Lead + Product |
| Critical | CAB |

🔹 Feature Flag Types

| Type | Lifetime |
|------|----------|
| Release | Temporary |
| Ops | Permanent |
| Experiment | Temporary |
| Permission | Permanent |

🔹 Rollback Triggers

- Error rate > 5%
- P99 latency > 2x baseline
- Health checks failing
- Customer reports

🔹 Rollback Commands

```bash
# Kubernetes
kubectl rollout undo deployment/api

# Feature flag
flags.disable('release_feature')
```

🔹 Change Types

| Type | Lead Time |
|------|-----------|
| Standard | Immediate |
| Normal | 1+ day |
| Emergency | Immediate |

🔹 Migration Safety

```
1. Add column (nullable)
2. Backfill data
3. Add constraint
```

🔹 Health Endpoints

```
/health/live   → Liveness
/health/ready  → Readiness
/health        → Detailed
```

🔹 Don't Forget

✅ Every deployment can roll back
✅ Feature flags for risky changes
✅ Test migrations on staging
✅ Monitor after deployment
✅ Document all changes
✅ Communicate releases
