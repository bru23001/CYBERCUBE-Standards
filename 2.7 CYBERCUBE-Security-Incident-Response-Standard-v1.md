CYBERCUBE Security Incident Response Standard (v1)

**Standard ID:** STD-SEC-005**Status:** Active**Effective:** 2026-01-17**Classification:** INTERNAL**Owner:** Security Team**Applies to:** All security incidents affecting CYBERCUBE systems or data

0. Purpose & Design Principles

This standard defines how CYBERCUBE detects, responds to, investigates, and
recovers from security incidents. It establishes procedures for evidence
preservation, regulatory notification, forensic analysis, and post-incident
improvement specifically for security-related events.

This standard is DISTINCT from the Incident Response & Reliability Standard,
which covers operational incidents. Security incidents require specialized
handling due to legal, regulatory, and forensic requirements.

Industry alignment:

- NIST SP 800-61r2 (Computer Security Incident Handling)
- ISO/IEC 27035 (Information Security Incident Management)
- SANS Incident Handling Process
- CISA Incident Response Playbooks
- GDPR Articles 33-34 (Breach Notification)
- SOC 2 Type II (CC7.3, CC7.4, CC7.5)

Design principles:

1. **Speed** — Rapid detection and containment
2. **Preservation** — Evidence integrity maintained
3. **Compliance** — Regulatory requirements met
4. **Transparency** — Appropriate stakeholder communication
5. **Learning** — Every incident improves defenses
6. **Accountability** — Clear roles and responsibilities

This document does NOT define:

- Operational incident response — see Incident Response & Reliability Standard
- Business continuity — see Business Continuity Plan
- Disaster recovery — see Disaster Recovery Plan

3.3 Phase 2: Triage

**Goal:** Assess severity and mobilize appropriate response.

Triage checklist:

```markdown
## Security Incident Triage

### Initial Assessment (< 15 minutes)
- [ ] What type of incident? (category)
- [ ] What systems/data affected?
- [ ] Is the attack ongoing?
- [ ] What is the potential impact?
- [ ] Initial severity assignment

### Escalation (if SEV-1/2)
- [ ] Page Incident Commander
- [ ] Activate SIRT
- [ ] Create secure incident channel
- [ ] Begin timeline documentation

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Preserve volatile evidence
- [ ] Isolate affected systems (if safe)
- [ ] Capture initial IOCs
- [ ] Document everything
```

3.4 Phase 3: Containment

**Goal:** Stop the spread and limit damage while preserving evidence.

**Short-term containment (immediate):**

- Isolate affected systems from network
- Disable compromised accounts
- Block malicious IPs/domains
- Revoke leaked credentials
- Enable enhanced logging

**Long-term containment (sustained):**

- Implement additional monitoring
- Deploy temporary controls
- Segment network if needed
- Maintain business operations

**Containment decision matrix:**

| Scenario                 | Action                    | Evidence Impact   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Active data exfiltration | Immediate isolation       | Accept some loss  |
| Dormant malware          | Image first, then isolate | Preserve all      |
| Compromised credentials  | Disable/reset immediately | Minimal impact    |
| Ransomware active        | Isolate immediately       | Accept some loss  |
| Reconnaissance only      | Monitor, prepare          | Full preservation |

3.5 Phase 4: Investigation

**Goal:** Determine root cause, scope, and timeline.

Investigation activities:

- Forensic imaging of affected systems
- Log analysis (SIEM, application, network)
- Malware analysis (if applicable)
- Timeline reconstruction
- Scope determination
- IOC extraction
- Attribution (if possible)

Key questions:

```markdown
## Investigation Questions

### Initial Access
- How did the attacker gain access?
- What vulnerability was exploited?
- When did the compromise occur?

### Scope
- What systems were accessed?
- What data was accessed/exfiltrated?
- What accounts were compromised?
- Is the attacker still present?

### Impact
- Was customer data affected?
- What is the business impact?
- Are there regulatory implications?

### Attribution
- What are the attacker's objectives?
- What TTPs were used?
- Any attribution indicators?
```

3.6 Phase 5: Eradication

**Goal:** Remove the threat completely from the environment.

Eradication activities:

- Remove malware and artifacts
- Patch exploited vulnerabilities
- Reset all compromised credentials
- Rebuild compromised systems (if needed)
- Close attacker access paths
- Remove persistence mechanisms

Eradication verification:

- [ ] All malware removed
- [ ] All backdoors closed

- [ ] Enhanced monitoring in place
- [ ] Business sign-off obtained
- [ ] No new IOC alerts (48 hours)

3.8 Phase 7: Notification

**Goal:** Meet legal and ethical notification obligations.

See Section 5 for detailed notification requirements.

3.9 Phase 8: Post-Incident

**Goal:** Learn and improve from the incident.

See Section 8 for detailed post-incident requirements.

4. Evidence Handling

Evidence must be preserved and handled properly for legal and forensic purposes.

4.1 Evidence Principles

1. **Preserve** — Maintain evidence integrity
2. **Document** — Record all handling
3. **Protect** — Secure from tampering
4. **Minimize** — Limit access to authorized personnel
5. **Legal** — Support potential litigation

4.2 Evidence Types

| Type          | Volatility | Collection Priority | Examples                      |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Memory        | Highest    | 1st                 | RAM dump, running processes   |
| Network       | High       | 2nd                 | Active connections, traffic   |
| Disk (live)   | Medium     | 3rd                 | Open files, temp files        |
| Logs          | Medium     | 4th                 | System, application, security |
| Disk (static) | Low        | 5th                 | Full disk image               |
| Physical      | None       | As needed           | Devices, documents            |

4.3 Evidence Collection Procedures

**Memory acquisition:**

```bash
# Linux memory acquisition (using LiME - Linux Memory Extractor)
# Note: /dev/mem is restricted on modern kernels (3.x+) and cannot dump full RAM
sudo insmod lime.ko "path=/mnt/evidence/memory.lime format=lime"

# Alternative: AVML (Acquire Volatile Memory for Linux)
sudo avml /mnt/evidence/memory.lime

# Windows memory acquisition (using winpmem)
winpmem.exe output.raw
```

**Disk imaging:**

```bash
# Create forensic image with hash verification
sudo dcfldd if=/dev/sda of=/mnt/evidence/disk.raw hash=sha256 \
  hashlog=/mnt/evidence/disk.hash

# Using dd with write blocker
sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/mnt/evidence/disk.raw bs=4M conv=sync,noerror
sha256sum /mnt/evidence/disk.raw > /mnt/evidence/disk.sha256
```

**Log collection:**

```bash
# Collect logs with timestamps preserved
tar -cvzf /mnt/evidence/logs-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz \
  --preserve-permissions \
  /var/log/

# Cloud logs (AWS CloudTrail)
aws cloudtrail lookup-events \
  --start-time "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z" \
  --end-time "2026-01-17T23:59:59Z" \
  > cloudtrail-events.json
```
