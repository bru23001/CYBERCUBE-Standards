CYBERCUBE Data Classification & Retention Standard (v1.1)

### Applicability Tier Table

| Applicability | Tier | Summary of Clauses in This Standard | Waiver Path |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------- | ----------- |
| All projects | **T1 MUST** | (1) Every data entity (table, collection, file class) MUST carry a classification label: `PUBLIC`, `INTERNAL`, `CONFIDENTIAL`, or `RESTRICTED`. (2) Every entity MUST have a declared retention period — either explicit (days/months/years) or `INDEFINITE` with a documented reason. (3) PII fields MUST be flagged and listed in a per-product PII inventory (at minimum a `PII.md` or equivalent). (4) Data deletion (soft or hard) MUST be auditable — who, what, when, via what mechanism. (5) Backup data MUST inherit the classification of the source. | None (non-waivable) |
| SaaS / customer-facing | **T2 SHOULD** | DSAR (data-subject access request) workflow with SLA, documented lawful basis per field group, encryption at rest (platform-managed), data masking in non-production environments, automated retention enforcement where platform allows, cross-border data transfer register. | Lightweight waiver per POL-GOV-001 §8.3 |
| Regulated / high-risk | **T3 MAY** | Legal hold system with per-entity flags, customer-managed-keys (BYOK/HYOK), automated DSAR with identity-verification gate, immutable audit trails for data access, tokenization/pseudonymization of PII, cross-jurisdiction data residency controls, regulated certifications (GDPR DPIA, HIPAA BAA, PCI segmentation). | Formal waiver per STD-GOV-003 |

> Per POL-GOV-001 §8.8.

> **v1.1 (2026-04-22) — Unfreeze (Path B).** T1 reduced to five rules documentable today: classification labels, retention periods, PII inventory, deletion audit, backup inheritance. Legal hold, DSAR automation, BYOK, GDPR DPIA reclassified to T2/T3 ROADMAP. This standard is **load-bearing** — [14] POL-REC-001 T1 and [19] STD-SEC-004 T1 both reference this classification schema.

1.4 Classification Inheritance

Data inherits the highest classification of its components:

```
Document containing:
  - Public content (PUB)
  - Internal metrics (INT)  
  - Customer name (CON)
  
  → Document classification: CONFIDENTIAL (CON)
```

1.5 Classification Labeling

| Context   | Labeling Method                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Database  | `classification` column on tables       |
| Files     | Metadata tag or filename suffix           |
| APIs      | Response header `X-Data-Classification` |
| Documents | Header/footer classification marking      |
| Emails    | Subject prefix `[CONFIDENTIAL]`         |

1.6 Reclassification

Classification changes require:

1. Data owner approval
2. Risk assessment (if upgrading)
3. Control adjustment
4. Audit log entry

Direction rules:

- Upgrading (e.g., INT → CON): Allowed with approval
- Downgrading (e.g., CON → INT): Requires DPIA review

2. Data Handling Controls

Each classification level has specific handling requirements.

```

5.3 Deletion by Classification

| Classification | Primary Delete     | Backup Delete         | Verification |
| -------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------ |
| PUBLIC         | Standard           | Next cycle            | None         |
| INTERNAL       | Standard           | Next cycle            | Log only     |
| CONFIDENTIAL   | Secure             | Within retention      | Audit log    |
| RESTRICTED     | Secure + overwrite | Immediate if possible | Certificate  |

5.4 Cascade Deletion

Parent deletion triggers child deletion:

```
Account deleted
    ├── User profile
    ├── All owned projects
    │       ├── Tasks
    │       ├── Milestones
    │       ├── Documents
    │       └── Comments
    ├── Messages
    ├── Invoices (archive, not delete)
    └── Audit logs (retain per schedule)
```

5.5 Deletion Verification

For RESTRICTED data:

```typescript
interface DeletionCertificate {
  certificate_id: string;
  data_type: string;
  data_identifiers: string[];
  classification: 'RESTRICTED';
  deletion_method: 'secure_delete' | 'crypto_shred';
  deleted_from: string[];       // System names
  deleted_by: string;           // USR-*
  deleted_at: string;           // ISO 8601
  verified_by?: string;         // For audit
  verification_method: string;
  retention_basis: string;
  legal_holds_checked: boolean;
}
```

5.6 Third-Party Deletion

When data shared with third parties:

1. Notify third party of deletion requirement
2. Request deletion confirmation
3. Document in deletion record
4. Verify (where possible)
5. Include in deletion certificate
6. Legal Hold

Legal holds preserve data relevant to litigation or investigations.

6.1 Legal Hold Process

```
Legal/Compliance initiates hold
      ↓
Define scope (data types, date range, custodians)
      ↓
Identify affected systems
      ↓
Implement hold (suspend deletion)
      ↓
Notify data custodians
      ↓
Document hold parameters
      ↓
Monitor compliance
      ↓
[Investigation/litigation concludes]
      ↓
Legal authorizes release
      ↓
Remove hold
      ↓
Resume normal retention
```

6.2 Legal Hold Record

```typescript
interface LegalHold {
  id: string;                    // LH-XXXXXX
  name: string;                  // "Smith v. CYBERCUBE"
  matter_number: string;         // Legal reference
  status: 'active' | 'released';
  
  // Scope
  scope: {
    data_types: string[];        // ["email", "documents", "chat"]
    date_range: {
      start: string;             // ISO 8601
      end: string;
    };
    custodians: string[];        // USR-* identifiers
    keywords?: string[];         // Search terms
    systems: string[];           // Affected systems
  };
  
  // Tracking
  created_by: string;            // Legal counsel
  created_at: string;
  released_by?: string;
  released_at?: string;
  
  // Documentation
  reason: string;
  external_counsel?: string;
  notes: string[];
}
```

6.3 Legal Hold Requirements

| Requirement               | Description                   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Scope documentation       | Clear definition of held data |
| Custodian notification    | Inform data owners            |
| Preservation confirmation | Verify hold is effective      |
| Periodic review           | Assess ongoing necessity      |
| Release authorization     | Legal approval required       |
| Audit trail               | Complete history of hold      |

6.4 Legal Hold System Integration

Systems MUST:

- Check legal hold status before deletion
- Prevent deletion of held data
- Log all hold-related actions
- Support hold search/identification
- Generate preservation reports

```sql
-- Legal hold check before deletion
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM legal_holds lh
JOIN legal_hold_scope lhs ON lh.id = lhs.hold_id
WHERE lh.status = 'active'

7. Backup & Recovery

Backups must maintain data classification and support compliance requirements.

7.1 Backup Strategy

| Backup Type      | Frequency          | Retention | Storage Tier |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | --------- | ------------ |
| Transaction logs | Continuous         | 7 days    | Hot          |
| Daily full       | Daily (02:00 UTC)  | 30 days   | Warm         |
| Weekly full      | Sunday (02:00 UTC) | 90 days   | Warm         |
| Monthly full     | 1st of month       | 1 year    | Cold         |
| Yearly archive   | January 1st        | 7 years   | Cold         |

7.2 Backup Classification

Backups inherit source classification:

| Source Classification | Backup Classification | Encryption    | Access              |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| PUBLIC                | PUBLIC                | Optional      | Standard            |
| INTERNAL              | INTERNAL              | At rest       | Standard            |
| CONFIDENTIAL          | CONFIDENTIAL          | At rest       | Restricted          |
| RESTRICTED            | RESTRICTED            | At rest + key | Strictly controlled |

7.3 Backup Encryption

| Component       | Encryption  | Key Management |
| --------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Backup data     | AES-256-GCM | KMS managed    |
| Backup metadata | AES-256     | KMS managed    |
| Transport       | TLS 1.3     | Certificate    |
| Tape/archive    | AES-256     | HSM + escrow   |

Key rotation:

- Data encryption keys: Annually
- Key encryption keys: Per policy
- Escrow keys: Secured with legal

7.4 Backup Testing

| Test Type            | Frequency | Scope            |
| -------------------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| Restore verification | Weekly    | Sample data      |
| Full restore test    | Quarterly | Complete system  |
| Disaster recovery    | Annually  | Full DR exercise |
| Integrity check      | Daily     | All backups      |

7.5 Backup Deletion

Backup deletion follows retention schedule:

```
Backup reaches retention end
      ↓
Check legal holds (all data in backup)
      ↓
If held: Retain until release
If not held: Proceed
      ↓
For tape/physical: Secure destruction
For cloud: Cryptographic deletion
      ↓
Verify deletion
      ↓
Update backup inventory
      ↓
Audit log entry
```

7.6 Recovery Procedures

| Scenario          | RTO      | RPO      | Procedure               |
| ----------------- | -------- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| File recovery     | 1 hour   | 24 hours | Self-service or support |
| Database recovery | 4 hours  | 1 hour   | DBA-assisted            |
| Full system       | 24 hours | 4 hours  | DR procedure            |
| Tenant data       | 4 hours  | 24 hours | Support-assisted        |

RTO = Recovery Time Objective
RPO = Recovery Point Objective

8. Data Processing Agreements

```typescript
// data-classification.ts

export enum Classification {
  PUBLIC = 'PUB',
  INTERNAL = 'INT',
  CONFIDENTIAL = 'CON',
  RESTRICTED = 'RST'
}

interface ClassifiedData {
  data: any;
  classification: Classification;

    const original = descriptor.value;
    descriptor.value = function (...args: any[]) {
      const result = original.apply(this, args);
      // Add classification header to response
      this.res.setHeader('X-Data-Classification', level);
      return result;
    };
  };

  deletion_method: 'soft' | 'hard' | 'secure' | 'crypto_shred' | 'archive';
  requires_verification: boolean;
}

const RETENTION_POLICIES: Record<string, RetentionPolicy> = {
  'user_profile': {
    data_type: 'user_profile',

  }
};

class RetentionService {
  async processRetention() {
    for (const [type, policy] of Object.entries(RETENTION_POLICIES)) {
      const expiredRecords = await this.findExpiredRecords(type, policy);
    
      for (const record of expiredRecords) {
        // Check legal holds
        if (await this.hasLegalHold(record)) {
          continue;  // Skip, held data
        }
      
        await this.deleteRecord(record, policy);
      }
    }
  }
  
  private async hasLegalHold(record: any): Promise<boolean> {
    const holds = await db.query(`
      SELECT 1 FROM legal_holds lh
      JOIN legal_hold_scope lhs ON lh.id = lhs.hold_id
      WHERE lh.status = 'active'
        AND lhs.data_type = $1
        AND ($2 BETWEEN lhs.date_start AND COALESCE(lhs.date_end, NOW()))

CYBERCUBE Data Classification — Developer Cheat Sheet

Print it. Pin it. Reference it.

🔹 Classification Levels

| Level        | Code | Examples            |
| ------------ | ---- | ------------------- |
| PUBLIC       | PUB  | Docs, marketing     |
| INTERNAL     | INT  | Reports, metrics    |
| CONFIDENTIAL | CON  | PII, customer data  |
| RESTRICTED   | RST  | Credentials, health |

🔹 Classification by Data Type

```
Password hashes     → RESTRICTED
API keys/secrets    → RESTRICTED
Payment card data   → RESTRICTED
Health data         → RESTRICTED

Email addresses     → CONFIDENTIAL
Phone numbers       → CONFIDENTIAL
Customer data       → CONFIDENTIAL
Invoices            → CONFIDENTIAL

Internal reports    → INTERNAL
Error logs          → INTERNAL
Metrics             → INTERNAL

Marketing content   → PUBLIC
Public docs         → PUBLIC
```

🔹 Encryption Requirements

| Level | At Rest | In Transit |
| ----- | ------- | ---------- |
| PUB   | No      | Optional   |
| INT   | No      | TLS 1.2+   |
| CON   | AES-256 | TLS 1.2+   |
| RST   | AES-256 | TLS 1.3    |

🔹 Retention Periods

```
User profile:      Account + 30 days
Session tokens:    Session + 24 hours
Login history:     2 years
Projects:          7 years (archived)
Invoices:          7 years
Support tickets:   3 years
Audit logs:        2 years
Error logs:        90 days
Daily backups:     30 days
Monthly backups:   1 year
Yearly backups:    7 years
```

🔹 Deletion Flow

```
1. Check legal holds → if held: STOP
2. Check retention → if active: STOP
3. Soft delete (30 day grace)
4. Hard delete
5. Purge from backups
6. Clear caches
7. Audit log
```

🔹 PII Handling

```
Collection:   Only what's needed
Storage:      Encrypted (CON/RST)
Access:       Role-based, logged
Sharing:      DPA required
Retention:    Per schedule
Deletion:     On request (30 days)
```

🔹 Data Subject Rights (GDPR)

| Right         | Response |
| ------------- | -------- |
| Access        | 30 days  |
| Rectification | 30 days  |
| Erasure       | 30 days  |
| Portability   | 30 days  |

🔹 Legal Hold Rules

```
When active:
✗ No deletion
✗ No modification
✗ No archival purge
✓ Normal access continues
✓ Must preserve all copies
```

🔹 Masking Patterns

```
Email:  j***@example.com
Phone:  +1-***-***-7890
Card:   ****-****-****-1234
SSN:    ***-**-1234
API:    sk_live_****XYZ
```

🔹 What You MUST Do

✅ Classify all data on creation
✅ Check legal holds before delete
✅ Encrypt CONFIDENTIAL+ at rest
✅ Log all CONFIDENTIAL+ access
✅ Honor DSAR within 30 days
✅ Follow retention schedule

🔹 What You MUST NOT Do

❌ Store passwords in plain text
❌ Log PII unmasked
❌ Delete held data
❌ Share without DPA
❌ Retain beyond schedule
❌ Skip classification

🔹 Quick Classification Test

```
Is it public info?           → PUBLIC
Internal business only?      → INTERNAL
Contains PII?                → CONFIDENTIAL
Credentials/health/finance?  → RESTRICTED
```
